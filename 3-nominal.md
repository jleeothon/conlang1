## Nominal paradigms

Nouns decline for number and case. There are weak and strong paradigms.

The weak noun paradigm requires a determiner; it is:

|           | Singular | Plural |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nom.-Acc. | -        | -an    |
| Gen.      | -as      | -ar    |

The weak adjective ending for all cases and numbers is: "-a".

The strong noun paradigm is used in literary contexts and when a determiner is
dropped; it is:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -         | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

There is an optional animacy distinction in the accusative singular: ⟨-am⟩ for
animate and ⟨-at⟩ for inanimate.

The strong adjective paradigm is used in literary contexts and when the noun is
omitted:

|      | Singular  | Plural |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Nom. | -a        | -ai    |
| Acc. | -am / -at | -an    |
| Gen. | -an       | -ar    |

The animacy distinction is the same as with nouns.

Personal pronouns:

|      | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc./comm./fem. | 1st pl. | 2nd pl. | 3rd pl. | 3rd refl. |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Nom. | ik      | þu      | he/þe/se                 | we      | je      | þej     |           |
| Acc. | mih     | þih     | hem/þem/sem              | uns     | jew     | þejem   | sih       |
| Gen. | mein    | þein    | hes/þes/ses              | unser   | jewer   | þejer   | sein      |

In the following tables, any **base form** and **irregular forms** are marked
with **bold**. Regular forms take endings from the strong noun paradigm (with
the inanimate ending).

The demonstrative pronouns are identical to demonstrative articles

|      | Proximal sg. | 〃 pl. | Medial sg. | 〃 pl. | Distal sg. | 〃 pl. |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Nom. | **þis**      | þisai  | **þas**    | þasai  | **jain**   | jainai |
| Acc. | **þit**      | þisan  | **þat**    | þasan  | **jait**   | jainan |
| Gen. | þisas        | þisar  | þasas      | þasar  | jainas     | jainar |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

Person (who, someone, no one, etc):



Other constructions are productive by _hwem + PREP_.

Thing (what, something, nothing, etc):

|                        | Nominative | Accusative | Plural |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Question               | hwa        | hwat       | hwas   |
| Existential sg.        | ihs        | iht        | ihsas  |
| Existential pl.        | ihse       | ihsan      | ihsar  |
| Elective (anything)    | erg ihs    | …          | …      |
| Negative (nothing)     | nihs       | niht       | nihsas |
| Universal (everything) | alls       | allt       | allas  |

Other constructions are productive by _hwat + PREP_.

Pro-adverbs:

The time adverbs' meanings are: when, now, then, such moment, sometime, never,
always.

The start-of-time adverbs' meanings are: whence, since now, thence, since such
moment, since sometime, since never, always (emphasis on a fact that has always
been true).

The end-of-time adverbs' meanings are: until when, until now, until then, until
such moment, until sometime; _nerg hwinl_ and _ew hwinl_ may not have a
practical definition but could be used by analogy.

Self-note: _hwinl_ doesn't sound too convincing. It originates from "hwan +
til".

The place adverbs' meanings are: where, here, there, such place, somewhere,
nowhere, everywhere.

The start (place) adverbs' meanings are: wherefrom, herefrom, therefrom, from
such place, from somewhere, from nowhere, from everywhere.

The end (place) adverbs' meanings are: whereto, thereto, thereto, to such place,
to somewhere, to nowhere, to everywhere.

The adverbs of manner's meanings are: how, in this way, in that way, in such
way, somehow, in no way, in every way.

Note that many determiners are similar to related pronouns, but differ in the
vowel.

Self-note: maybe possesives should not be determiners. They would follow the
noun modified, and are accompanied by the definite article e.g. _þen hund mien_
instead of _min hund_.
