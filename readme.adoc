# Þeudisk-H

Þeudisk-H is yet another constructed Germanic language, most influenced by
current reconstructions of Proto-Germanic, and some West Germanic daughter
languages.

Its design philosophy follows these principles:

- More inflectional morphology than modern West Germanic languages, but less
than Proto-Germanic.
- High degree of symmetry in derivation, conjugation, inflection despite
complexity.
- Freer word order.
- Mildly pro-drop.
- Revival of unproductive derivation principles.

## Developing

### On macOS

On macOS, we need `fswatch`, `fish`, and `mactex-no-gui`, and optionally `node`
(any recent version):

```
brew install fswatch fish
brew cask install mactex-no-gui
```

The fonts in `fonts/` must be installed manually.

A process can be started such that changes in `src/**/*.tex` will trigger a
build into `out/`:

```
bin/start.fish
```

### With Docker

Alternatively, we can develop with Docker and docker-compose. A container can be
started with:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will watch for changes in `src/**/*.tex` and will trigger a build into
`out/`.
