## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and determiners decline for number and case. There
are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive.

Nouns, and adjectives have strong and weak paradigms. The weak paradigm is
almost always used, and a determiner is obligatory.

The strong noun paradigm is used when a determiner is left out, but should be
used only for literary purposes.

The strong adjective paradigm is used when a noun is implicit (e.g. "the strong
(one)").

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form.

Word order is relatively free, but V2 order is preferred as in Norwegian. Verb
compounding is preferred to be head-final, but head-initial is allowed for
literary or emphatic purposes.
