The glottal stop is realised at the beginning of words that start with a vowel,
and between vowels at internal boundaries in composite words.

Notes:

⟨b⟩ can be realised as /b/ everywhere, but is recommended to be realised as:

- /b/ initially or when written ⟨bb⟩,
- /v/ medially between sonorants,
- /f/ medially otherwise and finally;

E.g. ⟨bér⟩ /bɛːr/ "bear", ⟨halb⟩ /half/ "half".

⟨g⟩ can be realised as /g/ everywhere, but is recommended as:

- /g/ initially and medially,
- /x/ finally.

Note: "sk" allows "dialectal variation" as /sx/ or /ʃ/, and optionally only
before "i" and "e".

I'm tempted to turn ⟨sk⟩ into ⟨sc⟩.

Haven't fully decided on the spelling and pronunciation of ⟨b⟩. In the
word-middle and word-end, it may be ⟨v⟩, thus the pronunciation better
distinguished.

Geminated consonants may exist. I'm not sure what to do with them, especially
when they occur at the word-end; they may be trigger tone change.

The combinations ⟨ji⟩ and ⟨wu⟩ may appear after another consonant, and be
pronounced as /i/ and /u/.

The combination ⟨ij⟩ may be found in verb paradigms, for consistency, and is
pronounced the same as ⟨ei⟩, thus /iː/.

/j/ and /w/ are realised respectively as /d/ or /b/ at the word end after a
consonant and may be assimilated to /t/ and /p/ after a voiceless consonant.
Thus:

- ⟨farw⟩ "colour" is realised /farb/, but
- ⟨farwan⟩ "colours" is realised /farwan/;
- ⟨stagj⟩ "stag" is realised /stagd/, but
- ⟨satgjan⟩ "stags" is realised /stagjan/.
