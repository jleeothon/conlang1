# Adpositions of place and time

Adpositions have several possible shapes.

They can be static prepositions that generally show where or when the referred
noun is; whereas directional prepositions show the direction towards which some
movement occurs.

For example:

- Þe kat hlaupt in þen hús. (_The cat walks inside the house_).
- Þe kat hlaupt into þen hús. (The cat walks into the house).

The predicative form functions as an adverb, for example:

- Þe

This is a list of place and time adpositions, and their derived terms.
Exceptions are marked with "`*`".
