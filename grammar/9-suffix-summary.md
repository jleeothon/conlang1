The grammatical class of words with bound suffixes can usually be guessed by the vowel in (bound) suffix:

- **a** is the usual vowel for adjectives (agreement), nouns, determiners,
- **e** is the usual vowel for verbs,
- **i** is the usual vowel for adjectives and adverbs (comparative and superlative degrees, and adverbialisation),
- **o** and **u** may appear within roots of nouns and adjectives due to euphony or fusion of very old PGe affixes.
