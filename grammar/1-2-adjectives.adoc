= Adjectives

== Inflection

Adjectives inflect according to their grammatical function, number, and case.

In the *predicative** form, the adjective does not inflect.

In the *attributive* form, a series of suffixes are attached to the adjective
according to case and number. An attributive adjective usually _precedes_ the
noun it modifies. When the adjective _follows_ its noun, it is prefixed with
"`gĕ`".
