# Folksprák Ortography

It uses a Latin-based alphabet.

## Vowels

They come in short and long pairs. The longer vowel is realised higher than the short vowel.

This language avoids diphtongs, except in loanwords.

- Open vowels: a, á
- Mid front unrounded vowels: e, é
- Mid front rounded vowels: ø, ǿ
- Close front unrounded vowels: i, í
- Close front rounded vowels: y, ý
- Mid back rounded vowels: o, ó
- Close back vowels: u, ú
- A mid central vowel, not represented in spelling.

The mid-central vowel can be freely before the last consonant in a word-final consonant cluster ending in /m/, /n/, /l/, /r/ (otherwise the last consonant is vocalic). Or it must be insiderted before the last consonant for words ending in /s/.

## Consonants

Stops:

| b | /b/ |
| p | /p/ |
| t | /t/ |
| d | /d/ |
| g | /g/ |
| k | /k/ |

Fricatives:

| v | /v/ |
| f | /f/ |
| ð | /ð/ |
| þ | /θ/ |
| h | /h/ at word-start, /x/ at the word-end |

Voiced fricatives devoice at the word-end, and this is reflected in writing. For example: líf > lívn (life > lives), kás > kézn (cheese > cheeses), paþ > peðn (path > paths).

Nasals:

| n  | /n/ |
| m  | /m/ |
| ng | /ŋ/ |

Aproximants:

| j | /j/ |
| w | /w/ |
| r | /r/ |

## Phonotactic rules

Consonant clusters allowed at the word-start as a typical West Germanic language.

Some consonants only follow short vowels: h.

Some consonants can be syllabic, in an unstressed position at the word boundary: n, m, r, l. These syllabic consonants can alternate with a mid central vowel.
