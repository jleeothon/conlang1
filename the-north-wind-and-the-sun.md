# Ðe Norð Wind ond ðe Son

Er wér en tím, ðe Norð Wind ond ðe Son stréden sih over hwilk af ðem ðe starkste wér.

En wandror hlíp bi. Þus wérn énig: ðe ðe kondut ðe kap

Once upon a time, the North Wind and the Sun fought over which of them was the strongest.

A traveller passed by. Then they agreed: the one who could remove the cape from the traveller was the strongest one.

First, the North Wind blew and blew, but the more the blew, the tighter the traveller held onto his cape. At last the North Wind gave up.

Then the Sun shone, and it was warm, and the traveller took off his cape.

And so the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
