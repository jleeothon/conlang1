## Introduction

My best (Germanic) languages are English and German. I have some knowledge of Dutch, Norwegian, and Platdüütsch. These shall be the reference languages.

The goal is only fun.

Some guidelines when refining the design of this language:

- Prefer Germanic roots.

It is not a goal to make a Pan-Germanic version of Anglish.

When defining the morphology of word roots, some things are avoided:

- The English Great Vowel Shift
- High German Second Consonant Shift

Some features are to be chosen because of their elegance as opposed to their widespreadness.

## Features

- SVO order.
- Three case system: nominative, oblique, and genitive. Nominative and oblique are not generally marked in nouns.
- Threefold gender-number system: singular common and neutral, and plural.

In comparison with other languages:

- From Dutch: pronomial adverbs e.g. op, erop, hierop, daarop, waarop, ergensop, nergensop, overalop.

The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him;
and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.

Ðe Nord Wind und ðe Sun had disputede hwilk was ðe starkere, hwan a traveler kám long, wrapped in a warm káp. Ðej (agreed) dat ðe én hwo érster erfolgede om á máke de traveler ták his káp af.

[On a hill,] a sheep that had no wool saw horses, one of them pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly. The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses." The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool." Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.
