## Phonotactic rules

Consonant clusters allowed at the word-start as a typical West Germanic language.

Some consonants only follow short vowels: h.

Some consonants can be syllabic, in an unstressed position at the word boundary: n, m, r, l. These syllabic consonants can alternate with a mid central vowel.
