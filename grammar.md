| SJ        | sj        | /ɕ/          |
| SK        | sk        | /sk/ or /sx/ |

Self-note: "sc" would be a mutation of "sk" in all positions. Not sure if I want
this.

Self-note: could try to turn more long vowels into glides so it's easier to
distinguish them.

Ideas:

- Should B become V in non-initial position?

## General grammar

Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and determiners decline for number and case. There
are two numbers: singular and plural. There are three cases: nominative,
accusative, genitive.

Nouns, and adjectives have strong and weak paradigms. The weak paradigm is
almost always used, and a determiner is obligatory.

The strong paradigm is used when a determiner is left out, but should be used
only for literary purposes.

Adjectives do not decline in the predicative form.

## Nominal paradigms

Nouns decline for number and case. There are weak and strong paradigms.

The weak noun paradigm:

|          | Nominative-Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Singular | -                     | -as      |
| Plural   | -i                    | -ar      |

The weak adjective paradigm:

|          | All cases |
| -------- | --------- |
| Singular | -a        |
| Plural   | -an       |

The strong noun paradigm (literary):

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -          | -am        | -as      |
| Plural   | -i         | -an        | -ar      |

The strong adjective paradigm (literary):

|          | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Singular | -a         | -am        | -as      |
| Plural   | -i         | -an        | -ar      |

Personal pronouns:

|                       | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1st sg.               | ik         | mih        | mein     |
| 2nd sg.               | þu         | þih        | þein     |
| 3rd sg. masc.         | hje        | hjem       | hjes     |
| 3rd sg. common.       | þe         | þem        | þes      |
| 3rd sg. fem.          | sje        | sjem       | sjes     |
| 1st pl.               | wi         | uns        | unser    |
| 2nd pl.               | ji         | juh        | jur      |
| 3rd pl.               | þej        | þejem      | þejer    |
| 3rd sg. & pl. reflex. | -          | sih        | sien     |

Self-note: instead of masc. and fem. pronouns, they could just be
proximal/medial/distal personal pronouns.

Demonstrative:

|              | Nominative | Accusative | Plural |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Proximal sg. | þeis       | þeit       | þeisas |
| Proximal pl. | þeise      | þeisan     | þeisar |
| Medial sg.   | þaus       | þaut       | þausas |
| Medial pl.   | þause      | þausan     | þausar |
| Distal sg.   | jain       | jait       | jainas |
| Distal pl.   | jaine      | jainan     | jainar |

Demonstratives are used for both people and things.

Person (who, someone, no one, etc):

|                      | Nominative | Accusative | Plural |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Question             | hwe        | hwem       | hwes   |

| Universal (everyone) | ew ain     | …          | …      |

Other constructions are productive by _hwem + PREP_.

Thing (what, something, nothing, etc):

|                        | Nominative | Accusative | Plural |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |

The time adverbs' meanings are: when, now, then, such moment, sometime, never,
always.

The start-of-time adverbs' meanings are: whence, since now, thence, since such
moment, since sometime, since never, always (emphasis on a fact that has always
been true).

The end-of-time adverbs' meanings are: until when, until now, until then, until
such moment, until sometime; _nerg hwinl_ and _ew hwinl_ may not have a
practical definition but could be used by analogy.

The place adverbs' meanings are: where, here, there, such place, somewhere,
nowhere, everywhere.

The start (place) adverbs' meanings are: wherefrom, herefrom, therefrom, from
such place, from somewhere, from nowhere, from everywhere.

The end (place) adverbs' meanings are: whereto, thereto, thereto, to such place,
to somewhere, to nowhere, to everywhere.

The adverbs of manner's meanings are: how, in this way, in that way, in such
way, somehow, in no way, in every way.

Note that many determiners are similar to related pronouns, but differ in the
vowel.

Self-note: maybe possesives should not be determiners. They would follow the
noun modified, and are accompanied by the definite article e.g. _þen hund mien_
instead of _min hund_.

## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular verbs.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Weak verbs have two stems: the present and preterite ones.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

### Strong verbs

Strong verbs follow an ablaut pattern. There are several ablaut patterns:

| Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| ei                 | ai              | i               |
| eu                 | au              | u               |
| e                  | a               | o               |
| i                  | a               | u               |
| e                  | a               | e               |
| i                  | a               | i               |
| a                  | u               | a               |
| ai                 | ei              | ai              |
| au                 | eu              | au              |
| a                  | e               | a               |
| a                  | i               | a               |
| á                  | é               | á               |
| ó                  | é               | ó               |

Here are some examples; each verb is provided in present and past infinitive,
and past participle:

- _streikan-straikan-strikun_ (to strike),
- _fleugan-flaugan-flugun_ (to fly),
- _helpan-halpan-holpun_ (to help),
- _bindan-bandan-bundun_ (to bind).
- _geban-gaban-gebun_ (to give),
- _sitan-satan-situn_ (to sit),
- _faran-furan-farun_ (to travel),
- _haitan-heitan-haitun_ (to be named),
- _hlaupan-hleupan-hlaupun_ (to walk),
- _fallan-fellan-fallun_ (to fall),
- _fangan-fingan-fagun_ (to grasp),
- _látan-létan-látun_ (to let),
- _hrópan-hrépan-hrópun_ (to call).

### Weak verbs

### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-preterite-present.md](./verbs-rückumlaut.md).

### Preterite-present verbs

In the present, preterite-present verbs have different stems for singular and
plural conjugations. The present infinitive has the same stem as the plural
conjugations.

The preterite stem is the same for all preterite finite and non-finite forms.

For an exhaustive list, see
[verbs-preterite-present.md](./preterite-present.md).

### Irregular verbs

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-irregular.md](./verbs-irregular.md).

## Derivation

A weak verb can be derived by changing the ablaut vowel, and in some cases,
Verner alternation. The meaning of the derived verb is usually causative, or
intransitive from a transitive verb.

| Strong ablaut | Weak causative   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| ei-ai-i       | äi               |
| eu-au-u       | äu               |
| i-a-u         | ä                |
| e-a-o         | ä                |
| e-a-e         | ä                |
| i-a-i         | ä                |
| a-ó-a         | ó? ő? eu?        |
| ai-ei-ai      | (not productive) |
| au-eu-au      | äu?              |
| a-i-a         |                  |
| á-é-á         | (Not productive) |
| ó-é-ó         | (Not productive) |

The consonant alternations are:

- þ > d
- s > r
- h > g

Examples include:

- _leiþan_ (to undergo) > _lädian_ (to lead)
- _beugan_ (to bend, intr.) > _bäugian_ (to bend sth.)
- _drinkan_ (to drink) > _dränkian_ (to make drink)
- _smertan_ (to hurt, intr.) > _smärtian_ (to cause pain)
- _hladan_ (to accumulate) > _hleudian_ (to load sth. into sth.)
