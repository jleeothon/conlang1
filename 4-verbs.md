## Verbs

Verbs conjugate for person, number, and tense. The non-finite forms include:
present and past infinitives, and present and past participles. The past
infinitive has a meaning of "to have done".

There are four types of verb according to conjugation paradigm: strong, regular
weak, rückumlaut, and preterite-present. In addition, there are irregular verbs.

Strong verbs three stems: the general one, one for most preterite forms, one for
the past participle.

Weak verbs have two stems: the present and preterite ones.

Preterite-present verbs have three stems: one for the present singular
conjugations, one for all other present forms (incl. infinitive and participle),
one for the preterite forms.

### Strong verbs

Strong verbs follow an ablaut pattern. There are several ablaut patterns:

| Present infinitive | Past infinitive | Past participle |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| ei                 | ai              | i               |
| eu                 | au              | u               |
| e                  | a               | o               |
| i                  | a               | u               |
| e                  | a               | e               |
| i                  | a               | i               |
| a                  | u               | a               |
| ai                 | ei              | ai              |
| au                 | eu              | au              |
| a                  | e               | a               |
| a                  | i               | a               |
| á                  | é               | á               |
| ó                  | é               | ó               |

Here are some examples; each verb is provided in present and past infinitive,
and past participle:

- _streikan-straikan-strikun_ (to strike),
- _fleugan-flaugan-flugun_ (to fly),
- _helpan-halpan-holpun_ (to help),
- _bindan-bandan-bundun_ (to bind).
- _geban-gaban-gebun_ (to give),
- _sitan-satan-situn_ (to sit),
- _faran-furan-farun_ (to travel),
- _haitan-heitan-haitun_ (to be named),
- _hlaupan-hleupan-hlaupun_ (to walk),
- _fallan-fellan-fallun_ (to fall),
- _fangan-fingan-fagun_ (to grasp),
- _látan-létan-látun_ (to let),
- _hrópan-hrépan-hrópun_ (to call).

Strong verbs conjugate with these endings:

|            | Present | Preterite |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | -an     | -an       |
| Participle | -end    | -un       |
| Imperative | -       |           |
| 1st. sg.   | -u      | -         |
| 2nd. sg.   | -es     | -es       |
| 3rd. sg.   | -et     | -         |
| 1st. pl.   | -em     | -em       |
| 2nd. pl.   | -ej     | -ej       |
| 3rd. pl.   | -en     | -en       |

Note that the preterite of strong verbs does not distinguish first and third
persons. Without context, the first person is assumed.

### Weak verbs

Class 1 weak verbs exist only derived from class 1 strong verbs. They conjugate
with these endings:

|            | Present | Preterite |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | -ian    | -idan     |
| Participle | -iend   | -id       |
| Imperative | -i      |           |
| 1st. sg.   | -iu     | -iud      |
| 2nd. sg.   | -ies    | -ides     |
| 3rd. sg.   | -iet    | -ied      |
| 1st. pl.   | -iem    | -idem     |
| 2nd. pl.   | -iej    | -idej     |
| 3rd. pl.   | -ien    | -iden     |

Class 2 weak verbs conjugate with these endings:

|            | Present | Preterite |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | -uan    | -udan     |
| Participle | -uend   | -ud       |
| Imperative | -u      |           |
| 1st. sg.   | -uu     | -udu      |
| 2nd. sg.   | -ues    | -udes     |
| 3rd. sg.   | -uet    | -ude      |
| 1st. pl.   | -uem    | -udem     |
| 2nd. pl.   | -uej    | -udej     |
| 3rd. pl.   | -uen    | -uden     |

These verbs are usually derived from adjectives and nouns.

### Rückumlaut verbs

They are a category of weak verbs whose present stems differ from preterite
stems by a vowel alternation, and sometimes exhibit a consonant alternation due
to the Germanic Spirant Law.

For an exhaustive list, see [verbs-preterite-present.md](./verbs-rückumlaut.md).

Rückumlaut verbs conjugate with these endings (dental suffix may be _d_ or _t_):

|            | Present | Preterite |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | -an     | -dan      |
| Participle | -end    | -ad       |
| Imperative | -∅      |           |
| 1st. sg.   | -g      | -du       |
| 2nd. sg.   | -gs     | -des      |
| 3rd. sg.   | -g      | -de       |
| 1st. pl.   | -em     | -dem      |
| 2nd. pl.   | -ej     | -dej      |
| 3rd. pl.   | -en     | -den      |

### Preterite-present verbs

In the present, preterite-present verbs have different stems for singular and
plural conjugations. The present infinitive has the same stem as the plural
conjugations.

The preterite stem is the same for all preterite finite and non-finite forms.

Preterite-present verbs conjugate with these endings (dental suffix may be _d_
or _t_):

|            | Present | Preterite |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| Infinitive | -an     | -dan      |
| Participle | -end    | -d        |
| Imperative | -∅      |           |
| 1st. sg.   | -g      | -du       |
| 2nd. sg.   | -gs     | -des      |
| 3rd. sg.   | -g      | -de       |
| 1st. pl.   | -em     | -dem      |
| 2nd. pl.   | -ej     | -dej      |
| 3rd. pl.   | -en     | -den      |

### Derivation

#### Causatives

A weak verb can be derived by changing the ablaut vowel, and in some cases,
Verner alternation. The meaning of the derived verb is usually causative, or
intransitive from a transitive verb.

| Strong ablaut | Weak causative   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| ei-ai-i       | äi               |
| eu-au-u       | äu               |
| i-a-u         | ä                |
| e-a-o         | ä                |
| e-a-e         | ä                |
| i-a-i         | ä                |
| a-u-a         | ü                |
| a-i-a         |                  |
| á-é-á         | (Not productive) |
| ó-é-ó         | (Not productive) |

> ⚠️ Self-note: the sequence a-u-a should, by PGe>Theudisk sound changes, be
> a-ó-a. But I'm considering a-ó-a, a-ú-a, a-u-a.
>
> The problem with a-u-a is that it may create derivative words that class. The
> problem that a-ó-a is that causative verbs would have the stem vowel
> "ó-umlaut", whose representation as "eu" is ugly, and the representation as
> "ő" would create a letter only marginally used. Also, would it have the same
> sound value as "eu"?
>
> The problem with a-ú-a, is similar: it could create a need for a letter "ű"
> (but it wouldn't conflict with "eu"). However, hlaþan-hlúþan-hláþun (to load,
> intr.) creates hlűdian-hlűdid. It may conflict with a verb from "hlúd"
> (noiise).

The consonant alternations are:

- þ > d
- s > r
- h > g

Examples include:

- _leiþan_ (to undergo) > _läidian_ (to lead)
- _beugan_ (to bend, intr.) > _bäugian_ (to bend sth.)
- _drinkan_ (to drink) > _dränkian_ (to make drink)
- _smertan_ (to hurt, intr.) > _smärtian_ (to cause pain)
- _hladan_ (to accumulate) > _hlüdian_ (to load sth. into sth.)
- _fallan_ (to fall) > _fällian_ (to fell)

#### Prefixes

- **fór**: before
- **after**: after
- **fer**: start to
- **fir**: wrong
- **or**:
- **in**: in
