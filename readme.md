# Conlang1

Design philosophy:

- inspired in Proto-West Germanic and Proto-Germanic,
- morphologically less complex than Proto-Germanic but more complex than modern
  Germanic languages,
- complex but highly symmetric,
- I have to like it.

Design guidelines:

- vocabulary biased towards Low Saxon, German, and Dutch,
- no Nasal-Spirant Law and no Second Consonant Shift,
- North Germanic loans integrated when they help find symmetry,
- pro-drop althought 1:1 perfect correspondences of ending and person-number.
