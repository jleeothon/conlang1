\section{Introduction}

Þeudisk-H is yet another constructed Germanic language, most influenced by current reconstructions of Proto-Germanic, and some West Germanic daughter languages.

Its design philosophy follows these principles:

\begin{itemize}
\item More inflectional morphology than modern West Germanic languages, but less complexity than Proto-Germanic.
\item High degree of symmetry in derivation, conjugation, inflection despite complexity.
\item Freer word order.
\item Mildly pro-drop.
\item Revival of unproductive derivation principles.
\end{itemize}
