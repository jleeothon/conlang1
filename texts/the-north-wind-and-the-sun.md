# Þe Norþerwind und þe Sonn

Þe Norþerwind und þe Sonn straiten sih över hwe ab þejem was þe starkira.

Te hwil hwat þej spraken, en wandror hleup langs þen weg, miþ ait káp.

Þe Sonn sagde: «Lát uns ainiginan þat þe hwe is starkir skal konnan nemman þet
káp þes wandrors snellir ab.»

«Hjus skal wi dón», andworded þe Norþerwind.

Þe Norþerwind blése und blése miþ þet alla starkiþ sien. Aber if filir blése if
filir þe wandror held þet káp sien an sih. Und þes upwand was för niht.

Þan biganne þe Sonn te skeinene. Warþ warm und þe wandror fralaused þet káp
sien. und þe Sonn skain starkir und warþ warmir. und þe wandror namm þet káp
sien ab.

Sjus muste þe Norþerwind togeban þat þe Sonn þe starkist ab þen baiþan is.

The North Wind und the Sun had an argument about who of both was the stronger.

While they spoke, a wanderer walked along the way, with a cape.

The sun said: «Let us agree that whoever is the stronger shall be able to remove
the wanderer's cape faster».

«In this way we shall do», answered the North Wind.

The North Wind blew und blew with all its strength. But the more it blew, the
more the wanderer held his cape to himself. und its effort was for naught.

Then the Sun began to shine. It turned warm und the wanderer loosened his cape.
und the Sun shone stronger und it grew warmer. und the wanderer took off his
cape.

So the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the strongest of them both.
