# Þe Norþrwind and þe Sonn

Þe Norþrwind and þe Sonn straiten sih över hwe ab þejem was þe starkira.

Hwils þej spraken, en wandror hleupe langs þen weg, miþ et káp.

Þe Sonn sagde: «Lát uns ainignan þat þe hwe is starkir skal konnan nemman þet
káp þes wandrors snellir ab.»

«Hjus skal wi dón», andworded þe Norþrwind.

Þe Norþrwind blése and blése miþ þet alla starkiþ sien. Aber if filir blése if
filir þe wandror held þet káp sien an sih. And þes upwand was för niht.

Þan biganne þe Sonn te skeinan. Warþ warm and þe wandror fralaused þen káp sien.
And þe Sonn skain starkir and warþ warmir. And þe wandror namm þet káp sien ab.

Sjus muste þe Norþrwind togeban þat þe Sonn þe starkist ab þen baiþan is.

The North Wind and the Sun had an argument about who of both was the stronger.

While they spoke, a wanderer walked along the way, with a cape.

The sun said: «Let us agree that whoever is the stronger shall be able to remove
the wanderer's cape faster».

«In this way we shall do», answered the North Wind.

The North Wind blew and blew with all its strength. But the more it blew, the
more the wanderer held his cape to himself. And its effort was for naught.

Then the Sun began to shine. It turned warm and the wanderer loosened his cape.
And the Sun shone stronger and it grew warmer. And the wanderer took off his
cape.

So the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the strongest of them both.
