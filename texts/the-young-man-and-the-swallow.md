Þe junga man und þe swalw

Was ain junga und reikja man, hwe was hail hrómig twiskir þen frijandan sein üm

Und þan aindagis in þet airiga warr ne mair had hwat övir, auk ne ait ainkila
penning, avir allain þen klaiþan sien.

Und hje most drepun ainan frijand avir ne had þet geld ümto kaupjun ainan niwa

an. Hje ging to ait klaiþhandlár und förkaupid þen klaiþan sien und kaupid ainan
niwa för sih.

To ainiga dagan latir, þei dagan plutsleik warþen kald und frustig. Und þe

arman or knewan sien, titirjid sih te tiel dauþ.

There was a young man, who was very popular among his friends because we was a
good spender. And he quickly wasted all his money.

One day in the early spring, he had nothing left, not even a single coin, but
his clothes.

And he had to meet a friend, but had no money to buy any new clothes. But he saw
a swallow fly by, and the young man thought that the summer arrived. And we went
to a clothes merchant and sold his clothes and bought himself new ones.

Some days later, the days suddenly became cold and frosty. And the swallow, and
the foolish man who barely had new summer clothes that did not cover his arms or
knees, shivered themselves to death.
