He fraged an einan kerkman: "Lát ain sun an mih wesun borun".

Þe kerkman saged an þen kuning: "Bedu an þen gud Werun".

Werun kwam niþir af himil. "Hwad willes?"

"I want a son."

"Þus skoled." saged þe berhta gud Werun.

And the king's lady bore a son.

There was a king and he was childless. The king wanted a son. He asked the
priest: "Let a sun to me be born".

The priest said to the king: "Pray to the god Werunos".

Werunos came down from heaven. "What do you want?"

"Will ait sun."

"So should it be.", said the bright god Werunos.

Und þe frauw þes kuningas bar ait sun.
