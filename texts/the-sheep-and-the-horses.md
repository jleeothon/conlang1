# Þe skáp and þe hrossi

En skáp, hwe had nen woll, sah eni hrossi: ait, hwe tauh et swára wagn; ait, hwe
drug et grauta hlőd; and ait, hwem en mann raid.

Þe skáp sagde an þen hrossi: «Þe hert mien is sair hwan ik sehu hwus þe mann
dreibet þen hrossi.»

Þe hrossi andwordden: «hlüsni(?) skáp. Þus leiþen unser herti: þe mann dot för
sih et klaiþ ut þet woll þes skáps and þe skáp ne filir häbet woll.

Þat hlüsnad flauh þe skáp til feld.

A sheep, who had no wool, saw some horses: one, who pulled a heavy wagon; one,
who carried a big load; and one, whom a man rode.

The sheep said to the horses: «My heart pains, when I see how the man drives the
horses.»

The horses answered: «Listen, sheep. Thus suffer our hearts: the man makes for
himself a garment out of the sheep's wool, and the sheep has no more wool.»

This heard, the sheep fled to the field.
