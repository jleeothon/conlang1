# þe skáp und þe hrossi

Ain skáp, hwe had nait woll, sah ainan hrossi: ait, hwe tauh et swára wagen;
ait, hwe drug ait grauta hlőd; und ait, hwem en mann raid.

þe skáp sagde an þen hrossi: «þe hert mien is sair hwan ik sehu hwus þe mann
dreibet þen hrossi.»

þe hrossi andwordden: «hlüsne þu skáp. þus leiþen þei hertan unswer: þe mann dot
för sih et klaiþ ut þet woll þes skápas und þe skáp ne filir häbet woll.

þat hlüsned, flauh þe skáp til þet feld.

A sheep, who had no wool, saw some horses: one, who pulled a heavy wagon; one,
who carried a big load; und one, whom a man rode.

The sheep said to the horses: «My heart pains, when I see how the man drives the
horses.»

The horses answered: «Listen, sheep. Thus suffer our hearts: the man makes for
himself a garment out of the sheep's wool, und the sheep has no more wool.»

This heard, the sheep fled to the field.
