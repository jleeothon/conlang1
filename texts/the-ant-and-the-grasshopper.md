In ait feld an ait sommurdag sang ain Grashoppár.

Ain meurj kwam bi, und bar ait hwaitjkorn to þes nest.

"Hwaför ne kwemmes und prates miþ mih", saged þe Grashoppár, "in städ af werkun
dih daud?"

"Helpo samilun etun för þet wintur", saged þe meurj. "Und skoldes mótun dón þet
sama."

Þe Gras-Hoppár saged: "Aver havem hjan hail filat etun."

Aver þe meurj ging þet weg þejar wiþir und werkwed wiþir.

Hwan þe wintur kwam, þe Gras-Hoppár ne had etun und bigann hungrwun, te hweil
sah þat þe meurjan elkan dag fördailden þet hwaitj af þet fórsamilun.

Und þe Gras-Hoppár wist: is bätir fórraidjun för þen nauddagan.

In a field on summer day a Grasshopper was singing.

An Ant passed by, bearing with great effort a kernel of wheat to its nest.

"Why don't you come and chat with me", said the Grasshopper, "instead of working
yourself to death?"

"I am helping to gather food for the winter", said the Ant. "And you should do
the same."

The Grasshopper said: "But we have very much food now."

But the Ant went its way further and worked further.

When the winter came, the Grasshopper had no food and started to hunger, while
it saw that the ants distributed wheat every day from the reserves.

And the Grasshopper knew: it is better to prepare for the days of necessity.
