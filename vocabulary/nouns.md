# Nouns

## Inflection paradigms

Nouns two numbers, singular and plural; and two cases, the common case and the genitive case. Pronouns distinguish the common case between nominative and oblique.

Rules for pluralisation of the common case:

- if the stem vowel is e, i, é, or í, then the pural form ends in _@r@n_, where the apostrophes are the mid central vowel and may be freely ellided;
- if the stem vowel is a, o, u, á, ó, or ú, then the stem vowel changes to æ, ø, y, ǽ, ǿ, or ý, respectively, and a suffix _@n_ is added;

where @ represents the mid central vowel, and may be freely ellided, and does not need to be represented in writing except for clarity, or explanation of derivation rules.

Back stems:

The genitive is formed by attaching -s at the end of a noun after declining it for its number.

Nouns based on verbs can be derived via the infinitive, the -ung suffix, or the passive preterite.

The __infinitive__, usually when the action itself is important e.g. ðen

The infinitive root and the __-ung suffix__, usually when the process is important e.g. ðen wonung (dwelling place).

The __passive preterite__, usually when the result is important. e.g. _ðen bund_ (the association), ð. For strong verbs, it omits the -n suffix.
