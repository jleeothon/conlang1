== Introduction

Verbs in conlang1 conjugate with person and number. Conlang1 is a pro-drop language.

Verbs can be conjugated for 3 persons, 2 numbers, and present and preterite tenses. The non-conjugated forms include:

- the infinitive--usually with the same stem as the present conjugations,
- the past infinitive--always with the same stem as the past conjugations and meaning "`to have done`",
- the active participle,
- the passive participle.

There are two main types of verbs: strong verbs and weak verbs. They differ in the preterite construction. Strong verbs have vowel alternations. Weak verbs have a dental suffix.

There are some irregular verbs.

The present conjugations vary in number and person. For both weak and strong verbs, the present tense endings are:
