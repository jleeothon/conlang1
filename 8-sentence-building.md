## Sentence building

Positive yes-no questions can be built by starting the question with a verb
followed by _ne_. Example:

- Etes ne krabbai? _Do you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _ja_ or _ne_.

Negative yes-no questions can be built by start the question with the negated
verb followed by _jah_.

- Ne etes jah krabb? _Don't you eat crabs?_

They are answered by: _jah_ or _neh_.

Clauses can also be joined by pronouns, which take the case of the referent in
the subordinate clause. For example:

- Þe hund sje blafet ilke dag is mein. _The dog which barks ever day is mine._
- Þe hund sjem sah was brún. _The dog which I saw is brown._
- Þe hund, sjes aiganor singet ilke morgin, is hail frijendleik. \_The dog,
  whose owner sings ever morning, is friendly.
